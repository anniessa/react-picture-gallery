# React Picture Gallery

## Description

_Duration: 1 Weekend_

For this weekend challenge, I expanded on a movie management application. Movies were already set up in a database and using Redux-Saga, I created a detailed view for each individual movie, including all genres associated with that movie. This is a very common pattern, to go from a list to showing more information about a single item.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)


## Installation

1. Create a database named `react-gallery`.
2. The queries in the database.sql file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on Postgres, so you will need to make sure to have that installed. I recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries.
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an npm install
4. Run npm run server in your terminal
5. Run npm run client in your terminal
6. The npm run client command will open up a new browser tab for you!

## Usage

1. The user can upload a url of a picture and write a description.
2. Upon clicking Submit, their photo will appear on the screen. Clicking on the picture will reveal its description.
3. The user can like the photo as well.
